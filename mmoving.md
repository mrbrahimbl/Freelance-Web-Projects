# mmoving.ca - Website Development Project

[mmoving.ca](https://www.mmoving.ca) is a website I developed for a moving company based in Toronto. This project provided an opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience and skills as a software development student. Here are some of the technical details and components of the website:

## Technical Details

### Platform: Wix
- The website was built on the Wix platform, a popular website builder that offers user-friendly features and design capabilities.
- Wix allowed me to create a responsive and visually appealing website tailored to the client's needs.

### Contact Form
- I integrated a contact form that enables visitors to request quotes, get in touch, or inquire about the company's services.
- The form collects user input and forwards it to the client for further action.

### Multilingual Support
- To reach a broader audience, I implemented translation functionality to make the website accessible in both English and French.
- This required creating content in both languages and providing a language switcher for visitors to choose their preferred language.

### Blog Section
- The website features a blog section that showcases informative articles about the moving industry, company updates, and related topics.
- I created and managed content in both English and French to cater to diverse readers.

### Responsive Design
- The website is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### Performance Optimization
- To ensure a smooth and efficient user experience, I optimized the website's performance, including page load times and image compression.

### SEO Best Practices
- I implemented search engine optimization (SEO) best practices to improve the website's visibility and rankings in search engine results.

### Analytics Integration
- To monitor the website's performance and user behavior, I integrated analytics tools to gather insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Future Development
As a software development student, I am committed to ongoing improvements and enhancements for mmoving.ca. Future developments may include new features, performance enhancements, and further SEO optimizations.
